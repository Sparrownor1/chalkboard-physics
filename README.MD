# chalkboard-physics

This is our project for TartanHacks 2021.

Intended to assist in the physics classrooms of the future, the program allows you to draw basic physics objects like balls and lines on a whiteboard or chalkboard (or even a notebook!), and run an animation that simulates their physical motion.

Instructions for use:

1. Set up the camera facing a place where you will draw objects
2. Run `project.py` and align the board within the rectangle on the screen
3. Press 'e' after you have drawn your objects
4. If they are not detected properly, press 'r' to redetect, other wise press any other key to see the simulation!
5. At any time, press 'q' to quit

Future features 

- Springs
- Multiple balls with collisions
- Starting velocity arrows
